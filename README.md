# sdet-challenge

Welcome to our Software Development Engineer in Test (SDET) repository. This README will guide you on how to participate in this challenge.

Please fork this repo before you start working on the challenge. We will evaluate the code on the fork.

## Scenario
 You are on a team that has built three new UI pages, and they have asked you to develop an automation framework and write automated tests to incorporate into their continuous integration process
 
## Challenge
Develop an automation framework and test scripts to effectively test the following web application pages:
  - http://the-internet.herokuapp.com/login
  - http://the-internet.herokuapp.com/inputs
  - http://the-internet.herokuapp.com/dynamic_loading
  
## Requirements
  - Write your solution in any programming lanugages to target UI elements and run the tests
  - Provide a brief explaination of how you approached your solution
  - Provide a breif explaination of possible next steps to incorporate your solution into CI/CD
  - Provide an explaination of how to run your tests


## Goal of Challenge
- Demonstrate your automated testing skills
- Demonstrate that you can think through testing scenarios and incorporate them into scripts using your automation framework
- Demonstrate your ability to write code that is:
  - **Readable**
  - **Maintainable**
  - **Reusable**

We look forward to seeing your solution!
