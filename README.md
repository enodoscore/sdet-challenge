# sdet-challenge

Welcome to our Software Development Engineer in Test (SDET) repository. This README will guide you on how to participate in this challenge.

Please fork this repo before you start working on the challenge. We will evaluate the code on the fork.

## Scenario
 You are on a team that has built two new features, and they have asked you to develop an automation framework and write automated tests to incorporate into their continuous integration process. Note they have not tested their pages yet and you may need to take that into consideration. There are no functional requirements for the new features, so use your best judgement on how the features should work.
 
## Challenge
Develop an automation framework and test scripts to effectively test the following web application pages:
  - http://the-internet.herokuapp.com/login
  - http://the-internet.herokuapp.com/inputs
  
## Requirements
  - Write your solution in any programming lanugages to target UI elements and run the tests
  - Test against your choice of browser. be sure to include the driver of your chosesn browser in your solution.
  - Provide a brief explaination of how you approached your solution
  - Provide a brief explaination of possible next steps to incorporate your solution into CI/CD
  - Provide an explaination of how to run your tests


## Goal of Challenge
- Demonstrate your automated testing skills
- Demonstrate that you can think through testing scenarios and incorporate them into scripts using your automation framework
- Demonstrate your ability to write code that is:
  - **Readable**
  - **Maintainable**
  - **Reusable**

We look forward to seeing your solution!
